- I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), advised by Prof. [Martin Jaggi](https://people.epfl.ch/martin.jaggi?lang=en).
- My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in the area of distributed training of deep neural networks. with Byzantine robustness, privacy, decentralized dataset(federated learning).
